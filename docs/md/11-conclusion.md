## Conclusion

- Data from web APIs often arrives in a format which is convenient to read, but not easy to modify
- Modern web apps have to do a lot of local data transformation
- Libraries such as Redux require immutable data transforms
- Immutable data transform on deeply nested API data is very difficult
- We can solve this by normalising our data structure so that it is flat and relational
